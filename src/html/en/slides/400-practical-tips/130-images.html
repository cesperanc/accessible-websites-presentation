    <ul>
        <li>Should have the <code>alt</code> attribute always set. This attribute <strong>provides a text alternative</strong> to the image and can be empty (but set) for images not relevant for understanding the content (e.g., decorative images or spacers).</li>
        <li>The <code>title</code> attribute provides additional information about the image and can be used to <strong>short descriptions</strong> (which can accessed by all users).</li>

    <ul>
        <li>More complex images <strong>may be described contextually in the content</strong> (e.g., by using a <code lang="en">figure</code> tag) or by adding a link near the image that guide the user to a document with a more complete description.</li>
        <li><strong>Background images</strong> should have a <strong>background color defined</strong> which provides sufficient contrast to read the text placed over it (if any); by doing this, if the image is not loaded by some reason, the text will still be readable.</li>
    </ul>
